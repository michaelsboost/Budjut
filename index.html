                  <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">I'm not a financial professional and this app is not financial advise. It's just merely my sole opinions and perspectives upon budgeting. That being said we'll proceed...<br><br> For the most part if you get good sleep, eat healthy and do moderate exercise this can save you so much money on transportation, medication, doctor bills, etc: while it may not erase those monthly checkups. Generally by living a healthy lifestyle you save more money. For example, Devices like Bas Rutten's O2 Trainer or the Wim Hof breathing method which have proven to help manage your asthma; thus can save you money long term. Another example of something I do which is I don't pay for a gym membership. I workout at home or just out at a local park. You can get fit without any equipment just a flat floor but if you need the extra weight you can easily fill a backpack with books and exercise with that. Another idea is to get a duffle bag and put 1 or more sand bags in it and duck tape which you can do bicep curls, tricep extensions, bench press, etc:<br><br>Whenever I'm unmotivated I look in what I call the accountability mirror and have a good long talk to myself summing it up in 1 simple sentence, "Excuses sound best to the person making them up!"<br><br>As far as transportation you can make it a regular habit of reducing the amount of weight in your vehicle thus saving you money in gas long term, and/or instead of driving to work you could ride the bus, car pool, ride a skateboard, scooter, walk or even ride a bike. Instead of paying for fast food you make your own at home. Instead of spending $1.75 for a bottle of water a day you could fill it at home, work, the office or McDonald's for free and save you $1.75/d - $13.30/w - $53.22/m - $638.75/y. Or even Starbucks coffee $7/d - $49/w - $196/m - $2,352/y. Another example would be to not pay for WiFi just use your phone's mobile data. I'm sure you can come up with other ways to save money as well, like price checking, coupons, etc:<br><br>Sometimes it's best to pay more to save more. Over the years I've had my share of cheap tools break in my hand like screwdrivers. So believe me when I say this it's best to pay the little extra money up front for a good tool then having to replace a cheaper one again and again. Always do your research first! Do they have a lifetime warranty, what's the company's history, is the company insured, majority of the review statistics, is the product new vs used, if used while it maybe cheaper why selling? These are just a few questions to ask before buying a good quality tool or product. Either it be a craftsman wrench, airless tires, an electric windproof plasma lighter, rechargeable batteries, etc:<br></p>

                      For a lot of people this can be a lifestyle change. In 2020 our whole planet experienced the COVID pandemic. Many people lost their job, business's fell to the ground, store shelves were empty, government mandates forcing citizens to stay in their homes, divorce rates skyrocketed, etc: Most of us that experienced the COVID pandemic never expected anything like that to happen, nor planned for it. So it's imperative to put money aside in your budget for emergencies, for retirement and death because we all will pass at some point. If you're a parent you're job is to make sure your child is well educated on being self sufficient and self sustaining while also living their life to the fullest. Part of that is also helping make their life easier after you pass. Prepay for your burial or cremation. It'll make an already difficult situation for them significantly easier.</p>

That's why it's smart to regularly put money in a savings account where it's available for whatever happens in the future.<br><br>"Saving is about mindset," says Bob Morrison, principal at Downing Street Wealth Management LLC, a financial planning firm in Littleton, Colo. "It doesn't matter whether you make minimal dollars or a significant amount, you should save a certain percentage and learn to live within that income because you have a responsibility to provide for yourself and your goals for the future."</p>

                  <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">There's lots of ways to make and lose money. Either it be in the stock market, crypto market, forex market, etc: Either it be day trading, swing trading, options, fractions, etc: some people just invest in dividends (a sum of money paid regularly (typically quarterly) by a company to its shareholders out of its profits (or reserves)) There's a lot of apps out there you can use to invest in like Robinhood, Webull, among others. With these two apps I mentioned if you register with my links you and I get a free stock.<br><br>In a nutshell, Robinhood is designed for complete beginners who are looking to trade stocks, ETFs, cryptos or options, all commission-free.<br><br><a href="https://referral.robinhood.com/michaes2685/?_branch_match_id=774097653577852610" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://referral.robinhood.com/michaes2685/?_branch_match_id=774097653577852610</a><br><br>Webull is meant for intermediate to advanced traders who are looking to trade stocks, ETFs, and options, all commission-free.<br><br><a href="https://act.webull.com/promotion/invitation/share.html?inviteCode=qERu1os6BXX7" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://act.webull.com/promotion/invitation/share.html?inviteCode=qERu1os6BXX7</a><br><br>There can be instances based upon your priorities where you tell yourself you just don't have room in your budget to be cutting expenses. In this case the only option is to make more money. Either it be leave your place of employment after acquiring another job that pays more or have a side hustle that can eventually replace your day job's income. Either it be drop shipping, resaling, wholesaling (aka flipping real estate contracts), affiliate marketing, blogging/vlogging, teaching, translating, etc: etc:&nbsp;<br></p>

                  <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-2">When To Buy or DIY</h4>
                  <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">I remember my dad taught me how to change and replace a faucet. He also taught me how to change and replace various household doors. These little things can save you a lot of money in the long run if you know what you're doing. If not it's best to educate yourself through reading, courses, maybe have a professional coach you to make sure you're doing it correctly or sometimes it's best to just hire a professional to do it themselves it all depends on you. There are of course other times where you know exactly how to do it you just don't want to spend the time on it you'd much rather focus your energy elsewhere especially if you have a business in this case hiring someone may also be best for your business. Again it all depends on you, your budget and your focus.<br><br>Sometimes it's also just nice to save by recycling and use things like plastic as rope, a bird feeder, a funnel, make into an ottoman, etc: or saving wood to use for a bon fire instead of having to pay for new wood, the sky's the limit here. You could even make more money recycling and refurbishing than you did when you got it.<br><br>Another example is this app I could've paid someone to make this app but because it's free and open source I would essentially receive no ROI (Return On My Investment) other than those ever so rare donations that come in once every 1 or two years. All the free and open source apps I've made I've done so not for the sake of money but to help evolve technology, educate others and simply to help make the world a better place. It's obviously not required but if I do get a donation I'm very thankful and grateful that my app helped you enough to give back and help me.</p>
